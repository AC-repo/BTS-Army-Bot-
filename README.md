Everything for the Army Bot
Explanation:
bts_info Dictionary:
This dictionary holds information about the group as a whole.
It's organized into sub-dictionaries for "concerts", "tours", "tv_shows", and "awards", making it easy to access and display specific information.
main_menu() Function:
The main menu now offers two choices: "Members" and "BTS Info".
bts_info_menu() Function:
This function displays a menu with the available categories for BTS information.
answer_query() Function:
It's modified to handle queries about "BTS" by accessing the bts_info dictionary.
It now checks if the member_name is "BTS" and handles the query accordingly.
general_info() Function:
This function is a placeholder for general information about BTS, which you can implement later.
How to Use:
Run the Script: Save the code as a .py file (e.g., bts_chatbot.py) and run it from your terminal using python bts_chatbot.py.
Interact with the Chatbot:
Choose "Members" from the main menu to explore information about individual members.
Choose "BTS Info" to view information about the group as a whole.
Explore BTS Information:
From the "BTS Info" menu, select a category like "Concerts", "Tours", "TV Shows", or "Awards".
The chatbot will display the relevant information.
Remember:
Fill bts_info: Update the bts_info dictionary with specific details about BTS concerts, tours, TV shows, and awards.
General Info: Implement the general_info() function to provide overall details about BTS (debut date, agency, fandom, etc.).
Enhancements: You can add more categories to bts_info as needed, improve the user interface, and use libraries like termcolor or ChatterBot to enhance the chatbot's functionality.
